FINA 4300/4400 - Open Studio Practice and Thesis I  II
Fall 2024
Course Description
This course provides the structure for both incoming and established senior Fine Arts students to develop greater depth and understanding of their studio art practice. Incoming 4300 students will identify an area of research and establish a dynamic, investigative approach and produce work with a consistent theme. The intent is to lay the groundwork for an innovative and cohesive body of work that will be focused and refined in 4400. The BFA candidates in 4400 will work toward the full conception of their spring exhibition.
In consultation with instructors, all students will identify their area of practice and develop an ensemble of appropriate materials and working methodologies. Through seminars and research, students will focus their ideas and discuss and debate the content of the works in progress. Regular critiques will provide feedback as well as foster the development of verbal skills. Written assignments will augment the studio work and encourage the ongoing evolvement of an artist statement.
